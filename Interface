What is an interface?
Ans:-
1. It will only abstarct methods
2. It cannot be intantiated - Means objects can't be make of it
3. By default , variables are "public static final " i.e, we don't have to write .
4. By default , methods are "public and abstarct "
5. No constructor in interfce

\\Example
interface Shape{
    double calculateArea();//method for calculating area of a circle
    double calculatePerimeter();//method for calculating perimeter of a circle
 
}
class Circle implements Shape{
    private double radius;
    
   //constructor
   public Circle(double radius){
       this.radius=radius;
   }
   
   public double calculateArea(){
       return Math.PI * radius *radius;
   }
   
   public double calculatePerimeter(){
       return 2 *Math.PI * radius ;
   }
    
}

class main{
    public static void main(String args[]){
        Circle cr=new Circle(5);
        
            System.out.println("Area of Circle is :" +cr.calculateArea());
            System.out.println("Perimeter of Circle is :" +cr.calculatePerimeter());
        
    
    }
}


Output:-
java -cp /tmp/rL2cHriumW main
Area of Circle is :78.53981633974483
Perimeter of Circle is :31.41592653589793


You are correct that interfaces in Java cannot have constructors, as they are meant to define a contract for classes to implement.
In the code example I provided, the constructor is actually part of the `Circle` class, which is a concrete class that implements the
`Shape` interface.

The constructor in the `Circle` class is used to initialize the `radius` field when a `Circle` object is created. 
This constructor is not part of the `Shape` interface but is necessary for creating instances of the `Circle` class.
The `Circle` class itself is implementing the `Shape` interface by providing implementations for the `calculateArea()` and
`calculatePerimeter()` methods required by the interface.

So, to clarify, the constructor is not part of the interface; it's part of the implementing class that provides concrete behavior for the methods 
declared in the interface.
