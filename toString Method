In Java, the toString() method is a predefined method provided by the Object class, which is the root class for all Java classes. 
The primary purpose of the toString() method is to return a string representation of an object. This string should be a concise and informative representation of the object's state.

class Stdetails {
    private String name;
    private int age;
    private String address;

    public Stdetails(String name, int age, String address) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
        this.address = address;
    }

    // If we want to print values, we should use toString() method
    public String toString() {
        return "Name: " + name + ", Age: " + age + ", Address: " + address;
    }
}

class Student {
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        Stdetails st1 = new Stdetails("Shreya", 23, "Bangalore");
        System.out.println(st1);
        Stdetails st2 = new Stdetails("Prachi", 24, "Piku");
        System.out.println(st2); // Use println to add a newline after printing st2
    }
}
